* Work
I am a lab head at the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research in Cambridge MA. My lab specializes in fragment based drug discovery (FBDD) and biophysical characterization of  biomolecules and their interactions using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). We integrate our NMR work with biochemical  and biophysical methods to guide drug discovery teams and drive medicinal chemistry efforts.

* Interests
** Music
In my free time I enjoy making music! I play violin, viola, guitar and enjoy singing.
I currently play with the [[https:https://www.kendallsquareorchestra.org/][Kendall Square Orchestra]], a wonderful community of amateur musicians from the local area.
** Coding
I use the Python Programming Language on a regular basis for my work. I also enjoy contributing to open source projects and believe that open and free software is the way to go. Below are some of  my favourite python libraries. I recommend checking them out if you don't know them.
