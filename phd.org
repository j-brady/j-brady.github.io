Tubule formation in the ER was shown by
[[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16469703][Voeltz et al (2006)]] to
require a class of membrane proteins with unusually short transmembrane
(TM) regions. These short TMs are thought to both "wedge" and "scaffold"
ER membranes into their tubular architecture. My work demonstrated that
a third component, amphipathic helices, is required for tubule formation
and that this component is likely to be evolutionarily conserved.

** The importance of ER tubules

      :CUSTOM_ID: the-importance-of-er-tubules
      :END:

The tubular ER comprises a highly dynamic, polygonal network of membrane
tubules with roles in cell transport, signalling and metabolism. The
ratio of sheet ER to tubular ER is cell type dependent. Cells
specialised in metabolism such as hepatocytes contain mainly tubules
whereas secretory cells (such as pancreatic acinar) contain primarily
sheet ER. The composition of the ER can change dramatically during the
cell cycle. For example during transition from interphase into mitosis
the ER transforms from being primarily tubular to sheet!

** ER tubules and disease
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: er-tubules-and-disease
      :END:

Dysfunction of the tubular ER network has been implicated in human
diseases such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and schizophrenia.
In particular proteins involved in the maintanence and dynamics of ER
tubules such as Spastin, Atlastin, REEPs and Reticulons have all been
implicated in HSP.
