* How to build website

** From within ~emacs~ session (recommended)
Currently recommended to use ~M-x~ ~org-publish-all~ from within a doom emacs session.
*** Syntax highlighting with HTMLize
I've been unable to figure out why syntax highlighting with HTMLize is not working for the batch process.
In order for src blocks to be correctly syntax highlighted it is necessary to build the site from within an emacs session using  ~M-x~ ~org-publish-all~ .
** Using ~Makefile~
The following ~Makefile~ can be used to build the webpage

#+INCLUDE: "./Makefile" src makefile

To build using the ~Makefile~ run the following:

#+begin_src bash
make clean-touch
make all
#+end_src
